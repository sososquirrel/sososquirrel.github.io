              <br>
             Squall lines are known to be the consequence of the interaction of low-level shear with cold pools associated with convective downdrafts. Also, as the magnitude of the shear increases beyond a critical shear, squall lines tend to orient themselves. The existing literature suggests that this orientation reduces incoming wind shear to the squall line, and maintains equilibrium between wind shear and cold pool spreading. Although this theory is widely accepted, very few quantitative studies have been conducted on supercritical regime especially. Here, we test this hypothesis with tropical squall lines obtained by imposing a vertical wind shear in cloud resolving simulations in radiative convective equilibrium. In the sub-critical regime, squall lines are perpendicular to the shear. In the super-critical regime, their orientation maintain the equilibrium, supporting existing theories. We also find that as shear increases, cold pools become more intense. However, this intensification has little impact on squall line orientation. </span>   </a>

            <br>
             We developed an automatic method to measure the orientation of tropical squall lines. This method relies on the convolutional product between the precipitable water field and a rotative gaussian filter. The video illustrates the algorithm for a case.  </span>   </a>

            <br>
             Based on the angles estimated from the different simulations, several conclusions of RKW theory have already been validated: the existence of two regimes, subcritical and supercritical, and the emergence of a critical shear near 12.5 m s−1. To quantitatively test the theory of squall line orientation, we plot the projection of the basal shear velocity perpendicular to the squall line Usfc  cos(a) in Figure 3 for the different simulation cases. The basal velocity is the average over the entire domain of the longitudinal component of the surface velocity. The angle that the wind speed makes with the direction perpendicular to the line corresponds to the angle determined by our method. </span>   </a>
